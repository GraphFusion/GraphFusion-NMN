# **GraphFusion v0.1.0 Release Notes**

## **Release Highlights**

GraphFusion v0.1.0 is the first public release of our AI-driven platform that combines **neural memory networks** with **knowledge graphs** to deliver a persistent, adaptable, and queryable memory system. This release lays the foundation for advanced, context-aware data management and retrieval in diverse applications such as healthcare, finance, and education.

## **Features**

### **Core Functionality**
- **Neural Memory Networks**:
  - **Dynamic Memory Cells**: Store and retrieve information over time with embedding-based memory management.
  - **Confidence Scoring**: Automatically evaluate the reliability and relevance of data in real-time.

- **Knowledge Graph Integration**:
  - **Node and Edge Relationships**: Organize data as nodes and edges with metadata, confidence scores, and semantic context.
  - **Queryable Graphs**: Support for subgraph extraction, filtering, and exploration.

### **Real-Time Adaptability**
- Continuous learning mechanisms to integrate new data and refine stored knowledge without retraining.
- Self-healing functionality for detecting and correcting inconsistencies in memory or graph data.

### **Querying and Recommendations**
- Support for **top-k similarity-based queries** to find relevant information using embeddings.
- Context-aware recommendations based on combined memory and graph reasoning.

## **Technical Enhancements**

- **Knowledge Graph Module**:
  - Built on `NetworkX` for fast and flexible graph management.
  - JSON export support for interoperability.

- **Memory Cell Module**:
  - Multi-head attention for better contextual processing of inputs.
  - Integration with LSTM for sequential data management.

- **SDK for Python**:
  - Simple API for initializing the system, processing inputs, querying, and interacting with the knowledge graph.

- **Extensible Architecture**:
  - Modular design for easy integration into external applications or customization for specific use cases.

## **Installation**

You can install GraphFusion directly via pip:

```bash
pip install graphfusion
```

## **Known Issues**
- Graph querying is limited to cosine similarity; additional metrics will be added in future versions.
- Real-time adaptability may require fine-tuning for very large datasets.
- Limited testing on edge cases in multi-threaded environments.

## **Future Plans**
- **Enhanced Querying**: Support for more advanced similarity metrics and graph-based search algorithms.
- **Visualization Tools**: UI-based tools to explore the knowledge graph visually.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Provide out-of-the-box embeddings for common domains (e.g., healthcare, finance).

## **How to Get Started**
