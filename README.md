# **GraphFusion**

**GraphFusion** is an AI-driven platform designed to revolutionize how data is stored, retrieved, and utilized. By combining **neural memory networks** and **knowledge graphs**, GraphFusion provides a unified, persistent, and queryable memory system capable of real-time learning, context-aware recommendations, and intelligent data organization.

## **Key Features**
1. **Neural Memory Networks**:
   - **Embedding-Based Memory Management**: Encodes data into embeddings for efficient storage and retrieval.
   - **Confidence Scoring**: Evaluates the reliability of stored information in real-time.

2. **Knowledge Graph Integration**:
   - **Structured Data Relationships**: Organizes data as interconnected nodes and edges for better representation.
   - **Semantic Understanding**: Enhances contextual comprehension by inferring relationships.

3. **Real-Time Adaptability**:
   - **Continuous Learning**: Dynamically updates memory with new data.
   - **Error Detection and Correction**: Maintains high data integrity by identifying and fixing inconsistencies.

4. **Modular Design**:
   - Works as a standalone library.
   - Easily integrates into various applications, such as intelligent assistants, healthcare systems, or educational tools.

## **Installation**

Install GraphFusion using `pip`:

```bash
pip install graphfusion
```

## **Quick Start**

Hereâ€™s how you can start using GraphFusion in your project:

### **1. Initialize GraphFusion**
```python
from graphfusion.sdk import GraphFusion

# Create a GraphFusion instance
fusion = GraphFusion(input_size=128, hidden_size=256, confidence_threshold=0.8)
```

### **2. Process Input Data**
```python
import torch

# Example input data
input_data = torch.rand(128)  # A random input vector
context = {"source": "sensor_1", "timestamp": "2024-11-15"}

# Process input through GraphFusion
result = fusion.process_input(input_data, context)
print(result)
```

### **3. Query the Network**
```python
# Example query vector
query_vector = torch.rand(128)

# Query the memory network for similar information
results = fusion.query(query_vector, top_k=3)
print(results)
```

### **4. Access the Knowledge Graph**
```python
# Access the underlying knowledge graph
graph = fusion.get_graph()
print(graph.graph.nodes(data=True))  # Print all nodes in the graph
```

## **API Overview**

### **GraphFusion Class**
#### `GraphFusion(input_size: int, hidden_size: int, confidence_threshold: float = 0.8)`
- **Parameters**:
  - `input_size` (int): Dimension of the input vector.
  - `hidden_size` (int): Dimension of the hidden layer.
  - `confidence_threshold` (float): Minimum confidence required to update the knowledge graph.

#### `process_input(input_data: torch.Tensor, context: Optional[Dict]) -> Dict`
Processes input data and updates the memory network.

#### `query(query_vector: torch.Tensor, top_k: int = 5, min_confidence: float = 0.0) -> List[Dict]`
Retrieves similar data from the memory network based on the query vector.

#### `get_graph() -> KnowledgeGraph`
Returns the underlying knowledge graph.

## **Use Cases**
- **Healthcare**: Organizing and retrieving patient data for context-aware diagnostics.
- **Finance**: Detecting fraud by mapping transactional relationships.
- **Education**: Building adaptive learning systems based on user interactions.
- **Intelligent Assistants**: Context-aware conversation systems with memory and reasoning capabilities.
