## Install GraphFusion üöÄ
Install GraphFusion and its dependencies via PyPI (Command not Ready Yet):
```bash
pip install graphfusion
```

GraphFusion supports Python 3.9 and above.


**GraphFusion AI** is an open-source Python library designed for building and utilizing Neural Memory Networks (NMNs). With GraphFusion, developers can create systems capable of learning from data dynamically while maintaining confidence-scored, queryable memory for applications such as intelligent assistants, healthcare, finance, and education.


## Features ‚ú®

- **Neural Memory Networks**: Real-time adaptable memory for dynamic data processing.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Organize data relationships and extract semantic insights.
- **Multi-Sector Applications**:
  - **Healthcare**: Analyze patient data and track medical history.
  - **Finance**: Detect fraudulent transactions.
  - **Education**: Provide personalized learning recommendations.

# Quickstart Guide üèÅ

### Set Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GraphFusion/GraphFusion-NMN.git
   cd GraphFusion-NMN
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install in Editable Mode (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```


### Examples üöÄ

#### Healthcare Use Case
Process patient data to track medical history and recommend care strategies.

```bash
python health_example.py
```

Example Output:
```json
{
  "Patient Result": {...},
  "Confidence": 0.527,
  "Knowledge Graph": {...}
}
```

#### Finance Use Case
Analyze transactions to detect fraudulent activities.

```bash
python finance_example.py
```

Example Output:
```json
{
  "Transaction Result": {...},
  "Confidence": 0.528,
  "Knowledge Graph": {...}
}
```

#### Education Use Case
Recommend peer groups based on student performance.

```bash
python education_example.py
```

Example Output:
```json
{
  "Student Result": {...},
  "Confidence": 0.527,
  "Knowledge Graph": {...}
}
```


## Architecture üîß

GraphFusion combines cutting-edge models for persistent AI memory:

- **MemoryCell**: Processes and updates memory dynamically.
- **KnowledgeGraph**: Creates structured relationships between data points.
- **NeuralMemoryNetwork**: Context-aware data analysis and recommendations.
