# GraphFusion

**GraphFusion** is an AI-powered platform that seamlessly integrates **Neural Memory Networks** with **Knowledge Graphs** to provide real-time, context-aware insights across various sectors. This platform combines the power of deep learning models and graph-based representations to enable personalized recommendations, data-driven decisions, and adaptive learning systems. 

### Key Features
- **Neural Memory Networks**: Real-time adaptable memory management using neural networks to store and process data.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: A graph-based structure that enables the organization of data relationships and semantic understanding.
- **Use Cases Across Sectors**:
  - **Healthcare**: Patient data analysis and medical history tracking.
  - **Finance**: Transaction processing and fraud detection.
  - **Education**: Student performance analysis and peer learning recommendations.

### Installation

To get started with GraphFusion, follow the steps below to install the platform and its dependencies.

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graphfusion.git
cd graphfusion
```

#### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment for this project to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Install in Editable Mode (for Developers)

To make changes to the project and run examples directly, you can install the package in editable mode. This allows you to modify the code and instantly reflect changes without needing to reinstall the package.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start using **GraphFusion** to process data for various use cases.

#### Example 1: Healthcare Use Case

In this example, we will process patient data and track medical history to identify similar patients based on input data.

```bash
python health_example.py
```

**Example Output**:
```json
Patient Processing Result: {
  "output": "tensor([...])",
  "confidence": 0.5272803902626038,
  "cell_id": "cell_3032974462495650720"
}

Similar Patients Based on Medical History: []

Patient Knowledge Graph: {
  "directed": true,
  "multigraph": false,
  "graph": {},
  "nodes": [],
  "edges": []
}
```

#### Example 2: Finance Use Case

In this example, we will process financial transaction data to detect potential fraud.

```bash
python finance_example.py
```

**Example Output**:
```json
Transaction Processing Result: {
  "output": "tensor([...])",
  "confidence": 0.5279827117919922,
  "cell_id": "cell_6645951537542080384"
}

Similar Transactions (Potential Fraud): []

Transaction Knowledge Graph: {
  "directed": true,
  "multigraph": false,
  "graph": {},
  "nodes": [],
  "edges": []
}
```

#### Example 3: Education Use Case

In this example, we will process student data to recommend potential peers for collaborative learning.

```bash
python education_example.py
```

**Example Output**:
```json
Student Processing Result: {
  "output": "tensor([...])",
  "confidence": 0.5271280407905579,
  "cell_id": "cell_-5565247167439004772"
}

Similar Students for Peer Learning: []

Student Knowledge Graph: {
  "directed": true,
  "multigraph": false,
  "graph": {},
  "nodes": [],
  "edges": []
}
```

### Architecture

- **MemoryCell**: A neural network model that processes input data and updates memory.
- **KnowledgeGraph**: Adds nodes and edges to the graph, allowing the organization of data relationships.
- **NeuralMemoryNetwork**: Provides context-aware recommendations by analyzing input data and context.

### Key Models & Classes
- **MemoryCell**: Handles input data, updates memory states, and outputs results.
- **KnowledgeGraph**: Adds nodes and edges to the graph and allows querying of related information.
- **NeuralMemoryNetwork**: Provides personalized recommendations by analyzing input data and context.
